This project automates the process of analyzing datasets, offering a comprehensive set of data analysis techniques and visualizations, powered by a large language model (LLM). It utilizes tools like regression, clustering, PCA, hypothesis testing, and missing value analysis to provide insights into the dataset, and generates visual outputs that can be included in reports. Additionally, it suggests appropriate analysis methods based on the data characteristics.
